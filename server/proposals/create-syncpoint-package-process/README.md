# Create SyncPoint Package Process

This folder contains [source files](./) and [exported charts](./exported) created with [drawio-desktop](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop).

> The [exported](./exported) folder also contains an [README](./exported/README.md) file that describes the exported charts while we discussed them during our dev meetings.

 You can find futher proposals for the SyncLink Server [here](../README.md).
